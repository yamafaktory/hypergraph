Hypergraph is a data structure library to generate **directed** [hypergraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph).

A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which a hyperedge can join any number of vertices.

## 📣 Goal

This library aims at providing the necessary methods for modeling complex, multiway (non-pairwise) relational data found in complex networks.
One of the main advantages of using a hypergraph model over a graph one is to provide a more flexible and natural framework to represent entities and their relationships (e.g. Alice uses some social network, shares some data to Bob, who shares it to Carol, etc).

## 🎁 Features

This library enables you to represent:

- **non-simple** hypergraphs with two or more hyperedges containing the exact same set of vertices
- **self-loops** — i.e., hyperedges containing vertices directed to themselves one or more times
- **unaries** — i.e., hyperedges containing a unique vertex

And to compute:

- Graph traversal: **BFS**, **DFS**, reachability, topological sort
- Shortest paths: **Dijkstra** point-to-point and single-source
- Structural analysis: strongly connected components, weakly connected components, all simple paths, subgraph extraction, cycle detection
- Filtered views: `retain_vertices`, `retain_hyperedges`

## ⚗️ Implementation

- 100% safe Rust
- Proper error handling
- Stable indexes for each hyperedge and each vertex — identity is the index, not the weight; duplicate weights are allowed on both sides
- Parallelism (with Rayon)
- Optional `serde` support (`features = ["serde"]` in `Cargo.toml`)

## 🛠️ Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml` (replace _current_version_ with the [latest version of the library](https://crates.io/crates/hypergraph)):

```toml
[dependencies]
hypergraph = "current_version"
```

## ⚡️ Usage

Please read the [documentation](https://docs.rs/hypergraph) to get started.

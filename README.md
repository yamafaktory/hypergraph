Hypergraph is a data structure library to generate **directed** [hypergraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph).

A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which a hyperedge can join any number of vertices.

## üì£ Goal

This library aims at providing the necessary methods for modeling complex, multiway (non-pairwise) relational data found in complex networks.
One of the main advantages of using a hypergraph model over a graph one is to provide a more flexible and natural framework to represent entities and their relationships (e.g. Alice uses some social network, shares some data to Bob, who shares it to Carol, etc).

## üéÅ Features

This library enables you to represent:

- **non-simple** hypergraphs with two or more hyperedges - with different weights - containing the exact same set of vertices
- **self-loops** - i.e., hyperedges containing vertices directed to themselves one or more times
- **unaries** - i.e., hyperedges containing a unique vertex

## ‚öóÔ∏è Implementation

- 100% safe Rust
- Proper error handling
- Stable indexes assigned for each hyperedge and each vertex
- Parallelism (with Rayon)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml` (replace _current_version_ with the [latest version of the library](https://crates.io/crates/hypergraph)):

```toml
[dependencies]
hypergraph = "curent_version"
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

Please read the [documentation](https://docs.rs/hypergraph) to get started.
